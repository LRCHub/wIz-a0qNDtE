Do ya do ya do ya think of speaking your mind?
Or as openly as lonely as it is cold?
And do ya do ya do ya wanna get heavyweight?
Or is it better off in the balance anyway?

Later on, oh, yeah whatever
Assume now, now became never ends

Well, how you do, it's up to you
But now you've got to see it through
Tell a man if you've had a change of heart

Do you make light of a bad situation?
By burying your head under the sand
And eat the apple of your eye
Just because your mouth is dry, oh

It doesn't really matter much to me
But honesty's a dyin' art
So tell a man if you've had a change of heart

Put against the wall and you'll play along
Give someone an answer and they'll think you're wrong
But now you find yourself
Somewhere you have never been before
Oh

You gave it time but to no avail
But now it's gon' be on the pail
Tell a man if you've had a change of heart
Oh, you can bite the bullet
Or just do it in a minute
For the love of God if you've had a change of heart
