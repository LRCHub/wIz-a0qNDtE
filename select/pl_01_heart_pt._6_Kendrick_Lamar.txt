Load up the Pro Tools
and press three
Studio filled with Jack
In The Box and Pepsis
Niggas watchin' WorldStar
videos, not the ESPYs
Laughin' at B. Pumper,
stomach turnin', I get up
and proceeded to write somethin'
Ab-Soul in the corner mumblin'
raps, fumblin' packs of Black
& Milds
Crumblin' kush 'til he cracked
a smile
His words legendary, wishin'
I could rhyme like him
Studied his style to define
my pen
That was back when the only
goal was to get Jay Rock
through the door
Warner Brother Records,
hope Naim Ali would let us know
Was excited just to go to
them label meetings
Wasn't my record deal, but
still, I couldn't beliеve it
Me and Rock inside thе booth
hibernatin'
It was simple math, if he made
it, that mean I made it
Everything I had was for the
team, I remained patient
Grindin' with my brothers, it
was us against them, no one
above us, bless our hearts
Use your heart and
not your eyes (Baby,
just relax and ride)
If you got time, then
I got time (Yeah, yeah)
Free your thoughts and
watch them fly
Use your heart and not
your eyes (Mm-hmm)
My nigga Dave had a
champagne Acura
A bunch of instrumentals I
freestyled in the passenger
That nigga wore several hats,
a producer, a manager,
director, and DJ
A hothead squabblin',
Bloods, Pirus, and Keeways
For this little thing of
ours we called TDE
I watched you take some
penitentiary chances to
say the least
Remember in the county
building with MixedByAli
We tried to freak the
system just to make a
couple ends meet
That's my nigga for shit sure
He brought Q over, but Q
didn't rap, but he learned
from our inspo
We split Louisiana chicken
riverboat specials
Sleepin' next to 02R consoles
to be our refuge
He was homeless and I left home
Q said, "Dot, you won't be
slept on, you the nigga to
bet on" (Use your h—)
Top had given us dominion in
the home he lived in
Hopin' that we see some
millions, God bless our
hearts
Use your heart and not
your eyes (Baby, just
relax and ride)
If you got time, then I
got time (Yeah, yeah)
Free your thoughts and
watch them fly
Use your heart and not
your eyes
Punch played Phil Jackson
in my early practices
Strategies on how to be
great amongst the averages
I picked his brain on what
was ordained, highly
collaborative
RET pushed the label
the same, amongst the savages
Moose kept my name in the
function that he would run in
TEEZ kept the vultures
away from me that was comin'
Sounwave let me borrow his
clothes for shows as a hype man
To cook up in this room 'til
the night ends
Time flies, I'm carryin'
debates of a top five
Buryin' my opps and allies
But I'd done a half job
communicatin' feelings of
being stagnant
Life was gettin' bigger
than just rappin'
The business, what I was lackin'
Top used to record me back
when it was poor me
And now we at the round
table for what assures me
I guess my motivation was
the yearnin' for independence
Poured everything I had left
in the family business
Now it's about Kendrick, I
wanna evolve, place my
skillset as a Black exec'
I jog my memory, knowin'
Black Hippy didn't work 'cause
of me
Creatively, I moved on with new
concepts in reach
Top, remember all them sessions
we would strategize
To hit the streets, then come
back, record three records? Ah
To tell the truth, it fucked me
up when D-Man passed
The motive was the condolences,
but the pride crashed
I had to bypass old mythologies
I had
Put my heart on display like
it was an iMac
To all my young niggas, let
me be the demonstration
How to conduct differences
with a healthy conversation
If that's your family, then
handle it as such
Don't let the socials gas you
up or let emotions be your
crutch
Pick up the phone and bust
it up before the history is lost
Hand-to-handshake is good
when you have a heart-to-heart
Use your heart and not your
eyes (Baby, just relax your
mind)
If you got time and I got
time (Yeah, yeah)
Free your thoughts and
watch them fly
Use your heart and not
your eyes (Mm-hmm)
